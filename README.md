# PyTerm

PyTerm is a terminal based on pure Python and nothing more.

## Installation

Go ahead on [PyTerm's website](markpavlenko.github.io/pyterm) and install the installation file.

## Commands Usage

In PyTerm, we don't use `sudo`. We use `super`. But there's some differences. Super let's you use `supercommands`, that a basic-user could not. To start using `super`, you have to type:
```PyTerm
super
```
But then it asks you for a password. The password is `etsugenfgr`.
Then, you'll have privileges to use the commands above:

`supertype`

`superexit`

`superexit`

`superinfo`

`superhelp`

and

`-h` add-ons. (Help)

If you want to use PyTerm as a normal user, you can obviously type these commands above without any superprivileges:

`help`

`info`

`pmdm`

`exit`

`super` (if you need supercommands)

and 

`-h` add-ons
